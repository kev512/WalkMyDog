## For Collaborators - implementation of new features

#### Attention!

On the **master** branch, only fully tested and working components, should be added. Each new feature should be developed on a separate, specially dedicated branch (the name of the branch thematically refers to the added functionality).

#### Adding a new feature

After cloning a project from the repository, by default you will be switched to the master branch (locally on your computer). To start creating new functionality, create a new branch:

> - Android Studio: on the lower right corner, click on **"master" > New Banch**
> - Create a name that will refer to the functionalities you create > **Create**

Now a new branch has been created on your local computer that you can code on.

> - To add changes to an existing branch, you must commit them: **VCS > :heavy_check_mark: Commit...**
> - **Commit Message**: Add a comment that will clearly describe what functionalities have been added by you **> Commit**

To add changes from your local computer to the repository server you must push them:

> - Android Studio: **VCS > Git > Push... > 'branch_name' --> origin : 'branch_name' > Push**
